# Core Renderer

This is a basic wgpu application, implementing the parametric function rendering algorithm.

To learn more about wgpu, we recommend checking out a tutorial. https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/#what-is-wgpu

This crate deals with

- Winit
- 
  - Abstracting over "running with a window" and "running in headless mode" (`window_or_fallback.rs`)
- Various utilities one usually sees in games
  - A struct to store transformations (translation, rotation, scale) (`transform.rs`)
  - Time keeping, with delta_time (`time.rs` and `time/frame_counter.rs`)
- Abstractions for wgpu objects
  - Color and depth textures (`texture.rs`)
- Autogenerated safe shader bindings via [wgsl_to_wgpu](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/wgsl_to_wgpu) (`shaders.rs` and `build.rs`)
- Benchmarking via [wgpu-profiler](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler) and [criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion2) (`benches/...` and `time/time_counters.rs`)
